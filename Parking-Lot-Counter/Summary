This code was designed to solve the following problem:
Consider a parking lot with a single entry and exit gate. There are two sensors (a & b), that are used to monitor the activity 
of cars passing through. When a object is detected by a sensor, it will output a 1. Design a program to
determine whether a car in entering or exiting, or whether a pedestran is passing through.

The following sequence indicates that a car enters:
 - Both sensors are off: (a & b = 0 )
 - Sensor a is triggered ( a = 1, b=0)
 -  Both sensor trigger (a & b = 1)
 - Sensor a is off (a =0, b=1)
 - Both sensor off ( a & b = 0)

 Solved:
 Design a FSM with two input signals (a and b), and two output signals (car_enter and car_exit).
 The car_enter and car_exit signals assert one clock cycle when a car enters and exits the lot respectively.
 Implement the system on the FPGA board utilizing two debounced pushbuttons to mimic the operaction of two sensor outputs. 
 Display the content on the seven segment display part of the FPGA board.
